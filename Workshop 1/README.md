# Workshop 1 â€” Entropy and Divide & Conquer

## Folders Structure
- [data/](./data): Contains data files generated by the program for sequence generation and motif detection.
- [docs/](./docs): Contains the project report.
- [src/](./src): Contains the source code files for the project.
- some databases are in a .zip due to their size and in the report 10 databases appear but in github there are only 9 because a file was so large that it did not allow its upload, in the same way the name of databases have the following syntax= "dataset --"number of sentences" "size of motives""--, and those to which Shanon's entropy was applied have the syntasis = --"new dataset "number of sentences" "size of motives""--
